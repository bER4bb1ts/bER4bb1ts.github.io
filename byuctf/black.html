            One cool thing about Vue is that it's really hard to figure out
            what's going on in the page Flag format - `byuctf{Phrase Separated

          This Challenge made me a bit blind and hate vue js :D<br />
          lets go, first thing the website wasn't have anything interested
          inputs/vulenrabilities and vue js obuscated the js code to make it
          hard to readable so i scrolled at the bottom and fired inspector and
          started see how website change.<br>
          while i was moving my mouse away there
          was a word has fade in "have fun!"<br />
          i understand how's website going in inspector there were some divs
          with ids pt1, pt2 once i moused over on them they showed parties for
          photos qr codes and be added in site source in inspector, so i
          collected all qr codes were 8 photos<br>
          <img src="imgs/partiesblack.png" alt="">
          <br><br>
          <a href="javascript:void(0);">and i combined them as a one
          valid QR Code,</a><br><br>
          <img src="imgs/combined.png" alt="">
          <br>
          after i scanned it i got a url
          "(http://black.byuctf.xyz/index_/)"<br />
          another page like previous one i used inspector to see the elements
          there was a video i changed the width and height to see it, its a
          rickroll video :( but i noticed there were some words shown in the
          video not shown in the real video on youtube i wrote them : ***And Our
          Home Oh Native Land Canada*** looks like be a canada anthem maybe i
          just slaped it on google and first result was wiki article, and yeah
          it a canada anthem i compared the original anthem with my ones and i
          re-arranged them to be a flag and i got Black Challenge Finally
