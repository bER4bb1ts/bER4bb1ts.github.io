        <p>
          At first, I'm not good at baseball and i don't know the game rules<br />
          when i saw baseball i didn't know he meant base encoding i recently
          discovered.<br></bnr> but my solve way was that i took this hash and put it to
          cyberchef and decoder.fr<br> also i did the same with crackstation.net to
          identify the hash but i got nothing so i moved to baseball game and i
          searched for the game rules and the information began to intertwine
          when i'm reading the rules i figured out that "A game is played out
          between two teams, each made up of 9 players"<br><br> and "The object of
          baseball is to score more runs than your opponent. The idea is to hit
          the ball thrown at you as far as you can before running around 4 bases
          to complete a run"<br><br> i really don't understand these words correctly but
          i thought with hacker mindset challenge says "baseball" so it starts
          with base for me i considered it for base encoding and while reading
          about rules it says "each made up of 9 players"<br> so i had to make sure
          that cyberchef it not a stupid i got a base29 encoded and i put it to
          cyberchef and nothing can't recognize it as decoder.fr so i made a python
          script and i tested the fake one and it worked, i grabbed the
          challenge encoded and put it and it worked too and returned the flag
          :DD<br> 
          <br>finally i got the Challenge
