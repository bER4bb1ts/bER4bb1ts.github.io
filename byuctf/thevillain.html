          <p>
            I've been hacked! Someone took a precious photo of mine and secured
            it in a password-protected ZIP folder. They taunted me by saying
            that the password is based on their personal life, but I'll never
            figure out who it is. I beg to differ! But all I've been able to
            find so far is this photo of my friend communicating with them, can
            you help me?

          Challenge provides 2 files,
          <br />
          one Screenshot.png and encrypted.zip i downloaded both and started
          with
          <br />
          the img first i extracted the img metadata and i found a google drive
          link
          [GooleDrive](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BnPoqSl7GQOST__5iR7Xv7lYB8kSIxFsLYSq9PXaJFY/edit)
          <br />
          <img src="imgs/villainempty.png" alt="">
          <br />
          nothing interesting for the first time and the zip file requires a
          password i fired pw cracker while it was running i returned to drive
          <br />
          again and i started to copy the content once i highlighted the content
          while copying i saw there is a small sentence: Message for Astoria
          Villin
          <br>
          <img src="imgs/astoria.png" alt="">
          <br>
           of course i started search with this name to get any social accounts or something like that
          <br />
          and i found a fb account and twitter with this username
          <br />
          [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/astoria.villin) |
          [Twitter](https://twitter.com/AstoriaVillin)
          <img src="imgs/astoriafb-.png" alt="">
          <br> 
          i started to discover the account
          stared to collect everything that can be used for password and the
          <br />
          challenge says: They taunted me by saying that the password is based
          <br />
          on their personal life so the password related to her life i collected
          her husband name: Jonathan and her pet name: Hoppy Boi husband not
          <br />
          worked so i tried pet name without spaces: HoppyBoi and it worked, and
          got the flag from the zip file
          <br />
